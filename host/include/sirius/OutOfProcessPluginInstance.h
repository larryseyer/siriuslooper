/// Engine-side handle for one `sirius_plugin_host` child process (V7 §9.1,
/// plan M7). Spawns the host binary at construction, exposes byte-stream
/// IPC over the child's stdin/stdout (S1 transport — S2 swaps in POSIX
/// shared-memory + SPSC rings), and tears the child down cleanly at
/// shutdown.
///
/// **Message-thread only.** This class has no audio-thread surface: every
/// public method may block, allocate, or invoke system calls. The S2 path
/// will add a separate audio-thread-safe `pump()` over the shared-memory
/// rings; until then, do not call these from `processBlock`-equivalent
/// contexts.
///
/// The instance is non-copyable + non-movable. The owner keeps it alive
/// for the lifetime of the hosted plug-in slot; `OutputMixer` will own
/// one per Constituent::EffectChain slot once S3 wires it in.
///
/// Deviation from M7 S1 spec: the original orchestrator decision was to
/// implement this on `juce::ChildProcess`, but JUCE's ChildProcess only
/// exposes a *read* path over the child's stdout — it cannot write to
/// the child's stdin. Identity pass-through requires both directions, so
/// this class uses POSIX `fork`/`pipe`/`execvp` directly. macOS + Linux
/// only for now; Windows lands when the platform-completion roadmap
/// (M23+) reaches it, per the macOS→iOS→Windows→Linux platform order.
