# Sirius Looper — Deferred Items

### 2026-05-14 — M0: Project skeleton & CI

- **Files:** n/a (external/operator actions)
- **What was deferred:**
  1. Throwaway FFmpeg-integration spike to de-risk M6 video.
  2. Operator verification that the standalone window launches and renders
     (build produces a valid `Sirius Looper.app` bundle; the window itself was
     not launched in this environment).
  3. CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is committed but unverified — it
     cannot run until the repo has a GitHub remote and a push.
- **Why deferred:**
  1. Exploratory; requires FFmpeg installed locally and is M6-scoped risk
     reduction, not M0-blocking.
  2. GUI testing is operator-run per project conventions.
  3. No remote configured; pushing is an explicit operator decision.
- **What's needed to finish:**
  1. Install FFmpeg, write a small decode-one-frame probe, confirm libav links
     cleanly via CMake on all three platforms. Do before/early in M6.
  2. Launch `build/app/SiriusLooper_artefacts/Release/Sirius Looper.app` and
     confirm the window opens, is resizable, and shows "Sirius Looper".
  3. Add a GitHub remote and push; confirm the CI matrix goes green on
     macOS/Windows/Linux.

**Resolved:** Ableton Link license procurement — the proprietary license is
already held (same licensing model as the sister app OTTO; see
`LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md`). No procurement action is outstanding.
