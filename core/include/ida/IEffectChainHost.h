/// Audio-thread interface a `Bus` calls into to dispatch one slot of its

/// `Channel`) hold an `IEffectChainHost*` set-once on the message thread
/// via `setEffectChainHost(...)`. The audio thread calls `pumpSlot` per
/// slot per buffer.
///
/// Lives in `core/` and is JUCE-free by design. The concrete out-of-process
/// implementation (`OutOfProcessEffectChainHost`) lives in `host/` and owns
/// the JUCE-bearing `juce::File` paths for binary + plug-in bundle. This
/// is the dependency-inversion seam — `Bus` (engine) does not know whether
/// its host runs plug-ins in-process, out-of-process, or in a mock.
///
/// **`busId` is `std::int64_t`, not the engine's strong-typed `BusId`**, to
/// keep this header in `core/` and thereby out of `engine/`'s dependency
/// graph. Engine-side callers pass `id_.value()`. The strong-typing lives
/// at the call site; this interface trades it for the layering benefit.
///
/// `pumpSlot` is the audio-thread surface — `noexcept`, allocation-free,
/// lock-free, bounded per `docs/RT_SAFETY_CONTRACT.md §6`. Implementations
/// that cannot meet that contract must reject the call (return false) and
/// arrange for production-time configuration to bypass the slot rather
