## RESUME HERE (2026-05-17 — M2 Session 1 shipped; Session 2 next)

**M2 Session 1 of the V7 alignment plan is on master.** The
`Membrane` → `LatencyTiming` rename landed (engine header, .cpp, test,
namespace `sirius::membrane` → `sirius::latency`, CMake wiring, test
tags), no behaviour change. The two M1 Session 3 load-publish tests
that flaked on cold-cache / sub-tick callbacks were stabilised via a
`pumpUntilPositive` helper that loops the callback until the clock
registers a non-zero elapsed (or hits a 1000-iteration safety cap).
The full `bash bash/autotest.sh` 4-phase gate passes — test count
holds at **270**, all green across five consecutive ctest runs. HEAD
is `ca92a08` on `origin/master`.

### First moves for the M2 Session 2 chat

1. Read this file end-to-end.
2. Open `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-v7-alignment.md` and skim
   lines 200-260 — Session 2's deliverables are spelled out at the
   "Sessions 1-3 broken out" subsection (line ~240). Session 2 adds
   the new types (no behaviour, just type shapes).
3. Read the operator-locked plan note: the `Control` SignalType TBD
   is **resolved** by the plan's "Risks & open decisions" entry —
   InputKind's Control / ParameterAutomation / Transport / System
   all map to `SignalType::File` for now (parameter tapes are JSONL
   files in SAF). No new operator question on that point.
4. Read the V3 transition guide for the interface sketches the
   skeletons need to honour:
   `docs/sirius-looper-v2-to-v7-transition.md`:
   - **lines 117-130:** `InputMixer` interface sketch
     (`register_input`, `add_channel`, `set_channel_tape_mode`,
     `process_buffer`, etc.)
   - **lines 164-175:** `OutputMixer` interface sketch
   - **lines 285-296:** Step-by-step Channel + SignalType narrative
   - **line 229 (V4 note — load-bearing):** the MIDI tape event must
     be **UMP-shaped from day one** (discriminated union over 32-bit /
     64-bit / 128-bit / 32-bit utility messages). Session 2 doesn't
     instantiate MIDI but the `Channel` / `SignalType` type design
     must not preclude UMP — don't bake in 3-byte MIDI assumptions
     anywhere in the skeleton signatures.
5. Implement Session 2's file additions:
   - `core/include/sirius/SignalType.h` (new — enum)
   - `core/include/sirius/InputKind.h` (modified — add `signalTypeOf` helper)
   - `engine/include/sirius/TapeMode.h` (new — enum)
   - `engine/include/sirius/Channel.h`, `engine/src/Channel.cpp` (new)
   - `engine/include/sirius/InputMixer.h`, `engine/src/InputMixer.cpp` (new — skeleton; bodies assert-false per Risks note line ~257)
   - `engine/include/sirius/OutputMixer.h`, `engine/src/OutputMixer.cpp` (new — same shape as InputMixer)
   - `engine/CMakeLists.txt` (modified — add the 3 new .cpps)
6. Verify with `rm -rf build build-xcode && bash bash/autotest.sh`;
   commit as `feat: M2 Session 2 — SignalType + TapeMode + Channel + Mixer skeletons`.
7. Session 3 adds the skeleton tests for the new types. Session 3
   commits and pushes.

What landed this session (M2 Session 1):

- `engine/include/sirius/LatencyTiming.h`, `engine/src/LatencyTiming.cpp`
  — new, namespace `sirius::latency`. Content is the verbatim former
  Membrane content with namespace + error-message string updates only.
  Two free functions: `inboundCaptureTime`, `outboundPresentTime`.
- `engine/include/sirius/Membrane.h`, `engine/src/Membrane.cpp` —
  deleted. Zero remaining `sirius::membrane::` references in the tree
  (verified by grep).
- `tests/LatencyTimingTests.cpp` — renamed from `MembraneTests.cpp`.
  Catch2 tags updated `[membrane]` → `[latency]`. Test descriptions /
  prose updated. Assertions byte-identical.
- `engine/CMakeLists.txt`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt` — updated.
- `tests/AudioCallbackTests.cpp` — added a `pumpUntilPositive` helper
  so the M1 Session 3 load-publish tests don't depend on a single
  cold-cache callback registering a non-zero tick delta. 1000-iteration
  safety cap so a fundamentally-broken clock can't hang the test.

**Plan deviations from M2 Session 1:**

- The plan predicted "expected hits in `engine/src/RenderPipeline.cpp`,
  `app/MainComponent.cpp`" for `sirius::membrane::` usages. **Zero
  actual hits in either** — `Membrane.{h,cpp}` was already unused by
  product code, only referenced by its own test. The rename surface
  was 3 files, not the 5+ the plan implied. Session 2's "Files
  touched" enumeration is more accurate (no widespread call-site
  rewrites needed).
- `video/include/sirius/FrameMembrane.h` + `video/src/FrameMembrane.cpp`
  are a separate concept (video frame timing) and are **explicitly
  out of scope** for M2 per the plan's narrow wording. Left untouched.

What landed this session (M1 Session 3):

- `audio/include/sirius/AudioCallback.h`, `audio/src/AudioCallback.cpp`
  — added `setAsrcInputs(std::vector<Asrc*>)`, `setAsrcOutputs(...)`,
  `setCalibration(const AudioDeviceCalibration*)` — non-owning,
  message-thread, set-once. New `std::atomic<double> lastCallbackElapsedSec_`
  published via `lastCallbackElapsedSec()`. The callback now wraps its
  work with `juce::Time::getHighResolutionTicks` and stores elapsed
  seconds at the end of every buffer. Buffer body is otherwise
  unchanged — still `memcpy + lmc_->advanceBySamples`.
- `app/MainComponent.{h,cpp}` — owns 2 input ASRCs + 2 output ASRCs
  (`std::unique_ptr<Asrc>`, `maxIoRatio=1.01`, quality from
  `EngineConfig`), one `AudioDeviceCalibration::identity()`, one
  `OverloadProtection`, one `RetroactiveRing<std::uint8_t>{1024}` (the
  `std::uint8_t` is provisional until the real tape-event type lands
  in M3/M4). The 30 Hz `timerCallback` reads
  `audioCallback_->lastCallbackElapsedSec()`, divides by
  `bufSize / rate`, calls `overloadProtection_.reportLoad(fraction)`.
  Diagnostics row in the Preparation pane gained a new `Load: X%
  of budget (shed: N)` line; the label height bumped 60 → 84 px to fit.
- `docs/RT_SAFETY_CONTRACT.md` — four `TBD` rows filled, with notes
  per piece (Asrc held-not-invoked; OverloadProtection driven from
  the message thread via atomic-published elapsed; RetroactiveRing
  explicitly off the audio thread; AudioDeviceCalibration held at
  identity until M8). New post-table paragraph describes the three
  shapes M1 Session 3 introduced.
- `tests/AudioCallbackTests.cpp` — 3 new `[load-publish]` cases:
  elapsed is 0 before any callback; positive (< 1 ms) after one buffer;
  resets to 0 on `audioDeviceStopped()`.

**Operator decisions locked in 2026-05-17 brainstorm (captured in
`~/.claude/plans/read-continue-and-proceed-partitioned-diffie.md`):**

- Q1 — *Strict scaffolding* (option A): engine pieces are reachable
  from the audio path's owners but the callback body remains
  `memcpy + lmc_->advanceBySamples`. ASRC at unity is NOT bit-identical
  (cubic/sinc interpolation), so routing through it would have broken
  the existing identity tests for no M1 benefit.
- Q2 — *Atomic publish, message-thread consumes* (option A). Mid-session
  refinement: the atomic publishes **elapsed seconds**, not the load
  fraction — division moves to the message thread. Net result:
  smaller audio-thread footprint (one `mach_absolute_time` pair + one
  atomic store; no division), testable without a JUCE device mock,
  same operator-facing behaviour.

**Subtle constraints worth carrying forward:**

- The diagnostics pane height grew (60 → 84 px) for the new Load
  line. If M2 adds another diagnostics line it'll likely need
  another bump, or a switch to dynamic height.
- `Asrc` is held by `AudioCallback` but not invoked. Compiler will
  warn about unused if any future cleanup tightens warnings — the
  member is intentional scaffolding; M2-M5 grow the call sites.
- `RetroactiveRing<std::uint8_t>` is a placeholder type parameter.
  The real `T` is the tape-event type that lands with the M3 SPSC
  tape-event queue. Renaming the member at that point is acceptable.

### Where M1 acceptance criteria stand (all green)

- [x] App registers an audio device on startup at user default sample
      rate / buffer size. (M1 Session 1 + 2/2 channel default.)
- [x] `AudioCallback::audioDeviceIOCallbackWithContext` runs identity
      pass-through within buffer budget. (Verified by autotest.)
- [x] LMC sample-clock fed from device callback. (M1 Session 2,
      tests `[sample-clock]`.)
- [x] `Asrc` / `OverloadProtection` / `AudioDeviceCalibration` /
      `RetroactiveRing` wired in. (M1 Session 3 — see RT_SAFETY_CONTRACT.md.)
- [x] `docs/RT_SAFETY_CONTRACT.md` lives in the repo with the per-PR
      audit checklist. (M1 Session 2 + Session 3 audit rows.)
- [x] Existing 256 ctest cases stay green — 270/270 now.

M2 (Membrane → Mixer rename + SignalType + Channel) is unblocked.

The auto-testing milestone (sections 0-5 below) is **closed and
shipped**. The CI signing handoff (3 of 6 secrets pending) is **still
open** — operator-only Keychain/AppleID work, doesn't gate M1+.
Treat sections 0-5 as historical state.

---

## HISTORICAL — Auto-testing CI signing handoff (still operator-pending, not blocking V7 work)

Auto-testing milestone is shipped on master. CI workflow is in place
but **first run will fail** until the remaining three repo secrets are
added.

**Already done this session (live in repo settings):**

| Secret | Status | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | ✓ set | `RR5DY39W4Q` |
| `APPLE_ID` | ✓ set | `itunes@larryseyer.com` |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | ✓ set | random 32-char base64 (throwaway, never leaves CI) |

**Still needed (require operator hands — Keychain GUI + appleid.apple.com):**

1. **`DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12_BASE64`** + **`DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD`** —
   export the Developer ID Application cert from Keychain Access:
   - Keychain Access → "login" → My Certificates
   - Find `Developer ID Application: Larry Seyer (RR5DY39W4Q)`. The
     disclosure triangle MUST show a private key under it (else the
     export is useless for signing)
   - Right-click → Export → save as `~/Desktop/sirius-devid.p12`,
     format: Personal Information Exchange (`.p12`)
   - Keychain prompts for an export password — pick anything
     memorable, this becomes `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD`
   - Keychain may also prompt for your login password to release the
     private key (normal)

2. **`APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`** — app-specific password for notarytool:
   - https://appleid.apple.com → sign in as `itunes@larryseyer.com`
   - Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords → "+"
   - Label `sirius-notarytool` and generate
   - Copy the 19-char password (`xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)

**Two paths to finish the handoff** (operator's choice on return):

- **Path A (operator hands the values to Claude):** drop the .p12 at
  `~/Desktop/sirius-devid.p12`, tell Claude the export password and the
  app-specific password. Claude runs the three `gh secret set` lines.
- **Path B (operator runs the gh commands):**
  ```
  gh secret set DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12_BASE64 < <(base64 -i ~/Desktop/sirius-devid.p12)
  gh secret set DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD --body "<the .p12 password>"
  gh secret set APPLE_APP_PASSWORD --body "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
  ```

**After all six secrets are in place — verification:**

```
gh secret list                    # confirm 6 entries
gh workflow run ci-macos-signed.yml
gh run watch                      # follow the live run
```

Expected: build + sign + verify all green. The "GUI smoke (best-effort)"
step may pass or skip on the GitHub-hosted runner — either is acceptable
(see continue.md §4 for why).

Once the workflow runs green: delete `~/Desktop/sirius-devid.p12`
(security hygiene — the secret is now in GitHub; the local copy is
no longer needed and exposes the private key if leaked). Then the
auto-testing milestone is fully closed out and the next session can
start on the white-paper alignment pass (§6).

## 0. Headline

**Auto-testing infrastructure milestone shipped end-to-end** on master
this session. Three commits, all pushed:

| SHA       | Subject                                                                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `4e8a1df` | fix: smoke-persistence.sh — direct binary launch + recursive AX walk + dialog-targeted clicks |
| `f68aa3c` | feat: bash/autotest.sh — local 4-phase macOS verification driver                              |
| (next)    | feat: ci-macos-signed.yml — signed-build + smoke CI workflow + this doc update                |

**Phase A — `bash/smoke-persistence.sh` patched and verified.** Five
AppleScript / Launch Services landmines worked around (catalogued in
§2). Round-trips Save → Load against the signed bundle, exits 0 with
"refs in file: 2" proving v2 shared-encoding ran.

**Phase B — `bash/autotest.sh` runs four phases locally** in ~25s
total on an Apple Silicon dev machine: headless ctest → signed Xcode
bundle build → codesign + spctl verification → GUI smoke. All four
green on master.

**Phase C — `.github/workflows/ci-macos-signed.yml` added** as a
separate workflow from `ci.yml`. Will fire on the next push to master
(this commit). Operator one-time setup: six repo secrets must be
added before the workflow can succeed — see §5.

**Next session = white-paper alignment pass** per the standing
operator sequencing (signing → auto-testing → white-paper alignment).
Auto-testing landed; alignment is up. See §6 for the picked-up
context for that work.

---

## 1. Build + test state

```bash
cd /Users/larryseyer/SiriusLooper
bash bash/autotest.sh        # full 4-phase verification, ~25s
```

Or individual gates:

```bash
# Headless only
cmake --build build --target SiriusTests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure        # 256 / 4283 expected

# Signed bundle only
cmake --build build-xcode --config Release --target SiriusLooper

# GUI smoke against the signed bundle
APP_BUNDLE="build-xcode/app/SiriusLooper_artefacts/Release/Sirius Looper.app" \
  bash bash/smoke-persistence.sh
```

The signed `.app` lives at `build-xcode/app/SiriusLooper_artefacts/Release/Sirius Looper.app`.
Developer ID Application: Larry Seyer (RR5DY39W4Q), hardened runtime,
audio-input entitlement, spctl-accepted.

The dev-loop `build/.app` is unchanged — ad-hoc-signed, fast iteration.

---

## 2. AppleScript / macOS landmines documented this session (for future GUI smoke work)

Each of these bit hard during Phase A. Recorded here so the next time
someone touches `bash/smoke-persistence.sh` or writes a new
osascript-based GUI driver, they don't have to rediscover them.

1. **`open ...app` returns -10825 on dev-tree paths.** Launch Services
   refuses to launch the Developer-ID-signed bundle from
   `build-xcode/...` even though `spctl` accepts it. The ad-hoc
   sibling at `build/...` opens fine. Suspected cause: the ad-hoc
   bundle's invalid `Identifier=Sirius Looper` (string with space)
   collides in LS with the signed bundle's valid
   `com.larryseyer.siriuslooper`. Workaround: launch the binary
   directly via `${APP_BUNDLE}/Contents/MacOS/${APP_NAME}` —
   bypasses LS entirely, more reliable for automation anyway.
   Root cause filed as its own todo entry.

2. **`entire contents of window 1` strips role info.** Iterating
   returns elements where `role of elt` doesn't resolve cleanly; the
   `AXButton` role check matched zero elements even when buttons were
   present. Workaround: explicit two-level recursion using
   `every UI element of window 1` then `every button of grp`.

3. **Tab buttons are nested one AXGroup deep.** JUCE's
   `TabbedComponent` exposes tab buttons as AXButton children of an
   AXGroup, not at the window's top level. Save/Load on the
   Preparation pane are similarly nested. Recursion in #2 catches
   both.

4. **`keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}` silently no-ops
   inside NSSavePanel/NSOpenPanel on Sequoia** when the filename field
   has focus. The text field appears to eat the modified keystroke.
   Workaround: `key code 5 using {command down, shift down}` (5 =
   physical 'g' keycode) fires the system shortcut reliably.

5. **NSSavePanel/NSOpenPanel open as separate top-level windows,
   not sheets.** `sheets of window 1` returns 0 after clicking
   Save/Load. The dialog is a sibling window whose name starts with
   the title prefix ("Save Sirius session..." / "Load Sirius
   session..."). Target it by `first window whose name starts with
   "..."` and click the action button by name. Bonus: NSOpenPanel's
   "Open" button stays *disabled* until a file is selected in the
   listing — Cmd+Shift+G navigates to the directory but doesn't
   select, so the smoke script falls back to Return when the action
   button is disabled.

6. **Activate-and-keystroke must be in the same osascript block.**
   When `tell application "X" to activate` and `keystroke ...` are
   issued from separate osascript invocations, focus can slip back
   to the terminal between calls and the keystrokes land in the
   wrong app. Solution: combine them in one heredoc.

---

## 3. The three small follow-ups surfaced this session

All filed in `todo.md` near the top. None block anything; all are
"while we're in this neighborhood" cleanups.

1. **`com.apple.security.get-task-allow=true` in signed entitlements.**
   Visible in `codesign -dv --entitlements -` output. Fine for non-
   notarized dev builds; rejected by Apple's notarization service.
   Must be `false` (or absent) before any notarized release. Likely a
   Xcode default the CMake block needs to override.

2. **`open` returns -10825 on the signed dev-tree bundle.** Root cause
   of landmine #1 above. Workaround in place in the smoke script;
   investigation deferred. End-user launches against a notarized
   bundle in /Applications are not affected.

3. **Ad-hoc `build/` bundle has invalid `Identifier=Sirius Looper`.**
   Should be `com.larryseyer.siriuslooper` to match the Xcode-gen
   build. The mismatch is the leading suspect for #2's LS confusion.
   Fix the CMake config that sets the bundle ID on the Unix Makefiles
   target.

---

## 4. CI status

`ci.yml` (the original push/PR matrix):
- macOS: green (headless tests).
- Linux + Windows: red on a pre-existing int64→juce::var ambiguity in
  `persistence/src/SessionFormat.cpp`. **Explicitly deferred** under
  the `feedback-mac-first-linux-windows-last` rule — not a candidate
  for "what's next."

`ci-macos-signed.yml` (added this session):
- Will fire on the next push to master. **First run will fail**
  because the six required secrets are not yet in the repo. Operator
  step: add them per §5, then push (or `workflow_dispatch`) to verify.
- GUI smoke step is `continue-on-error: true` from day one — GitHub-
  hosted macOS runners can't grant the runner user Accessibility
  permission without SIP-disabling tricks that hosted runners don't
  support. Build + sign + codesign-verify is the hard gate; smoke is
  best-effort signal.

---

## 5. Operator one-time setup before CI signing works

In GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:

| Secret name                    | Value source                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12_BASE64` | Export `Developer ID Application: Larry Seyer (RR5DY39W4Q)` from Keychain Access as `.p12` with a password, then `base64 -i Developer-ID.p12 \| pbcopy` |
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD`   | The `.p12` export password just set                                                                         |
| `APPLE_ID`                     | `itunes@larryseyer.com` (per `reference-apple-id` memory)                                                   |
| `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`           | App-specific password from appleid.apple.com (NOT the Apple ID password — generate one specifically for notarytool) |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                | `RR5DY39W4Q`                                                                                                |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`            | Any opaque string the operator picks — used as the throwaway CI keychain password                            |

`APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` aren't strictly
needed for the current workflow (no notarization step yet), but
they're listed here so they get added once and are ready when
notarization moves into a release-tag workflow.

After secrets land: trigger the workflow via `workflow_dispatch` in
the Actions tab (or just push), and verify the run goes green
("GUI smoke: PASS" or "GUI smoke: SKIPPED/FAILED on CI runner" —
either is acceptable; build + sign + verify must pass).

---

## 6. Next milestone — white-paper alignment pass — SUPERSEDED-AND-SPEC'D 2026-05-17

The alignment pass that this section queued has been spec'd in full at
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-v7-alignment.md` (24 milestones across
11 parts; M1 = Audio I/O foundation + RT-safety contract audit; see
RESUME HERE at the top of this file). The original V2 white paper
referenced below is superseded by V7 (`docs/Sirius_Looper.md`); the
V2→V7 transition guide (`docs/sirius-looper-v2-to-v7-transition.md`)
is the bridge.

Original §6 contents preserved for historical context follow; treat as
read-only:

> Per the operator's stated sequence (signing → auto-testing → white-
> paper alignment). Auto-testing is done; alignment is up.
>
> **Reading order before starting alignment work:**
>
> 1. `docs/Sirius Looper Whitepaper V2.md` — the white paper.
>    *(Superseded — read V7 at `docs/Sirius_Looper.md` instead.)*
> 2. `docs/Sirius Looper User Guide.md` — the operator-facing how-to.
> 3. `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-shared-placement-design.md` — the
>    most-recent shipped spec.
> 4. `todo.md` — alignment-adjacent entries.
>
> **What this session does NOT decide:** the scope, structure, or
> deliverables of the alignment pass. That's the next session's first-
> half work (brainstorm + spec) before any code lands.
>    *(That brainstorm + spec is what 2026-05-17 produced. The plan
>    file is the output.)*

## 7. Authoritative references

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — global rules (auto-loaded).
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-larryseyer-Sirius-Looper/memory/MEMORY.md`
  — auto-memory index (auto-loaded). Two new entries this session:
  - `feedback-mac-first-linux-windows-last` (Platform order:
    **macOS → iOS → Windows → Linux**; iOS = AUv3 only)
  - `feedback-esc-while-typing-is-not-abort` (silent tool rejections
    usually mean the operator is mid-message)
- `todo.md` — deferred items register. Auto-testing milestone marked
  SUPERSEDED-AND-IMPLEMENTED at the top; three new follow-ups filed
  beneath it; legacy GUI-smoke and Load-dialog entries updated to
  reflect resolution.
- `/Users/larryseyer/.claude/plans/read-continue-and-proceed-floating-pelican.md`
  — the auto-testing plan that just shipped. Self-contained, can be
  archived or kept as a structural template.
- `bash/autotest.sh` — single command for full local verification.
- `bash/smoke-persistence.sh` — GUI smoke driver (operator must have
  Accessibility access granted to the shell that runs it).
- `.github/workflows/ci-macos-signed.yml` — signed CI workflow (six
  secrets required, see §5).
- `docs/Sirius Looper Whitepaper V2.md` and
  `docs/Sirius Looper User Guide.md` — next milestone's primary
  source material.

---

## 8. One-paragraph orientation if everything else has changed

Auto-testing infrastructure is in place. `bash/autotest.sh` is the
local one-shot gate; `ci-macos-signed.yml` is the per-push CI gate
(needs operator-added secrets to actually run, see §5). Next
milestone is the white-paper alignment pass — that's a design
session, not a code session, so start with brainstorm + spec before
touching `app/` or `ui/`. Linux/Windows remain explicitly deferred.
