# Session Continuation — S3c SHIPPED: OTTO audio pump end-to-end through IDA's transport bar (pending operator T17)

## ▶ 0. TL;DR (60 seconds)

S3c shipped this session via subagent-driven development: two OTTO commits (T15 split + T15-fixup) + one IDA atomic commit (T16). The IDA-side OTTO audio pump now drives OTTO's full housekeeping prefix + per-channel sum + housekeeping suffix on every audio block. The previous session's blocker (`renderBlock` skipped `processBlock` entirely → SPSC AudioMessage queue never drained → conductor never advanced → sfizz never noteOn'd → silence) is closed.

End-to-end at HEAD: ctest **813 passed / 1 not-run = 814 total** (+5 over pre-S3c baseline of 808/1). Clean rebuild + IDA target build + full ctest all verified. Two independent code-quality reviewers + one final cross-cutting review approved.

**Next chat:** operator-run T17 verification. Launch `IDA.app` via the Desktop `IDA` alias, load an LSAD kit on Player 1 in OTTO's tab, press Play in the IDA transport bar — audible drumming expected. If silent, the failure is narrow per design spec §7 (Output Mixer wiring of OTTO outputs into master, or asset edge case) — not S3c scope. T17 checklist is at the bottom of this file (§5).

## ▶ 1. SHAs at end of session

| Thing | SHA | Note |
|---|---|---|
| IDA HEAD (origin/master) | **f4111bba** | T16 atomic: submodule pin + interface sig + OttoHost.h/.cpp + AudioCallback caller + 3 test files |
| OTTO HEAD (IDA's pin) | **ee390098** | T15-fixup: CMake target ref + test rigor + comment polish |
| OTTO HEAD (origin/main, upstream) | **ee390098** | equals IDA's pin |
| OTTO prior commit (T15 initial split) | `d9fc41a0` | parent of ee390098; carries the verbatim move |
| lsfx_tapecolor (IDA's pin) | `0a7189c` | unchanged this session |

Working tree end-of-session: `m external/sfizz` only (pre-existing 64-channel patch the build applies on every configure — leave alone).

Also pushed this session: spec `7431e15` and plan `6ae911e` (docs commits before the implementation chain).

---

## ▶ 2. What landed this session, in order

Every implementation task ran through `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` — fresh implementer subagent per task → spec compliance reviewer → code-quality reviewer → fix loop if needed → mark complete. Brainstorm → spec → plan → execution all in one session.

### Pre-implementation (controller-driven)

1. **Brainstorm via `superpowers:brainstorming`**. Explored `processBlock` end-to-end (line 665–1122), mapped 27 steps to "must-run in IDA" / "must-NOT-run in IDA (master conflict)" / "either-way". Result: only ONE step is architecturally contested (`outputRouter_.routeAudio` + downstream tail). Three architecture options surfaced; operator chose "wide architectural pass" with full deferral; locked design B (OTTO splits processBlock; IDA calls prefix + processGlobalMixer + suffix).
2. **Spec written** at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-otto-audio-pump-design.md` (432 lines). Self-review cleanup pass for placeholders + contradictions. Commit `7431e15`.
3. **Implementation plan written** at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-28-otto-audio-pump.md` (1098 lines). T15 (OTTO split, 9 sub-steps) + T16 (IDA atomic, 14 sub-steps) + T17 (operator verify checklist). Commit `6ae911e`.

### T15 — OTTO: split processBlock (subagent-driven)

- **OTTO `d9fc41a0`** — implementer: declared `processBlockBeforeRouting` + `processBlockAfterRouting` public methods; moved lines 665-1069 verbatim into BeforeRouting; moved lines 1111-1118 verbatim into AfterRouting; rewrote `processBlock` as wrapper (`ScopedNoDenormals` + `cpuMeter.begin` + BeforeRouting + routing branch verbatim + AfterRouting + `cpuMeter.end`). Added public `getConductor()` non-const + const accessors (mirrors `getPlayerManager()` / `getOutputRouter()` pattern — needed for the new test). Created `tests/unit/test_processblock_split.cpp` + registered as `test_processblock_split_app` in OTTO's `tests/CMakeLists.txt`. Inbox entry appended. `Ida-Origin: pending` trailer. Pushed.
- **Spec review** ✅ verbatim move discipline confirmed, sanity-grep invariants all match (`processAudioMessages()`=2, `outputRouter_.routeAudio`=1, `ScopedNoDenormals`=1, etc.). Audio-thread invariant sweep on diff: zero forbidden patterns.
- **Code-quality review** ✅ APPROVED with one Important fix recommended + 3 minor polish items. The Important: `tests/CMakeLists.txt` linked nonexistent `otto_plugin_shared` target (plan-template bug — should be `otto::engine` = S1 static target).
- **OTTO `ee390098`** (T15-fixup) — implementer landed: (1) CMake target `otto_plugin_shared` → `otto::engine`; (2) equivalence test rewritten from vacuous empty-buffer byte-equality to honest transport-state-parity (drops fragile routing-branch mirror); (3) "Half A/B" decoder-ring comments renamed to "housekeeping prefix/suffix / OTTO master mixdown (skipped by IDA's pump)"; (4) `getConductor()` docstring threading-paragraph dropped to match sibling-accessor precedent. Inbox fixup-ack appended. Pushed.

### T16 — IDA: pump wire (atomic commit, subagent-driven)

- **IDA `f4111bba`** — implementer atomic commit covering 10 files (plan said 9; +1 was a justified extension to keep the build green):
  - Submodule pin → `ee390098`
  - `core/include/ida/IOttoRenderSource.h` — forward-decl `juce::MidiBuffer` in `namespace juce`; rewrite `renderBlock` to take `(int, juce::MidiBuffer&) noexcept = 0`. Doc-comment explains the deliberate JUCE-bleed in core/.
  - `otto-bridge/include/ida/OttoHost.h` — signature update + `<juce_audio_basics/juce_audio_basics.h>` include.
  - `otto-bridge/src/OttoHost.cpp` — new `renderBlock` body: guards → `ScopedNoDenormals` → `processBlockBeforeRouting(midi, N)` → `processGlobalMixer(N)` → `processBlockAfterRouting(N)`. Stale S1-era comments at Impl ~lines 148-160 and old renderBlock ~lines 230-238 REPLACED with brief design-spec pointer (not just supplemented).
  - `audio/src/AudioCallback.cpp` — line ~87 caller now passes a stack-local `juce::MidiBuffer ottoMidi;` (RT-safe: default-constructed MidiBuffer doesn't allocate). `<juce_audio_basics>` newly added.
  - `tests/OttoHostRenderTests.cpp` — 11 call sites mechanically updated to pass `juce::MidiBuffer midi;` stack-local. Assertions preserved.
  - `tests/OttoHostTransportControlTests.cpp` — same mechanical update + new `CapturingListener`-based TEST_CASE asserting `Kind::Started` snapshot fires after `play() + renderBlock + drainForTesting`.
  - `tests/OttoHostPumpTests.cpp` (NEW, 148 lines) — 4 TEST_CASEs: `[play]`, `[tempo]`, `[stop]`, `[channel-accessor]`. Each tests a distinct behavioral aspect of the end-to-end pump.
  - `tests/AudioCallbackTests.cpp` — `CountingSource` test stub's `renderBlock` override updated to new signature (mechanical signature propagation — caught during the build's fail-mode pin and added to the atomic commit because the test binary wouldn't link otherwise).
  - `tests/CMakeLists.txt` — registers the new pump-test source.
  - Single-line message: `feat: S3c — IDA OTTO audio pump (processBlock split + renderBlock MidiBuffer)`. Pushed.
- **Spec review** ✅ Both declared deviations (CountingSource + TransportTracker priming) assessed as honest. The priming step mirrors OTTO's `TransportTracker::detectAndPublishChanges` design (returns early on `hasReceivedFirstUpdate_==false`); in production the audio callback fires many blocks before the user clicks Play. The priming is the test-side mirror of that production reality, not a workaround for an IDA pump bug.
- **Code-quality review** ✅ APPROVED with 3 Important polish items flagged for follow-on (not blockers): forward-decl bleed doc could be sharper; priming-step duplication invites a `primeTransport()` helper; `[channel-accessor]` test comment slightly overclaims what the assertion proves.
- **Final cross-cutting review** ✅ SHIPPED. Contract holds across the submodule boundary; signatures match; RT-safety inherits cleanly from the verbatim move; Play → audio → EventBus → SPSC → Timer → listener chain traces end-to-end through code at HEAD; operator handoff ready.

## ▶ 3. Architecture as it stands

OTTO `processBlock` is now a wrapper:

```
processBlock(buffer, midi):
  ScopedNoDenormals + cpuMeter.beginMeasurement
  processBlockBeforeRouting(midi, N)        ← drains SPSC, updates transport,
                                              fires TransportEvent, dispatches
                                              MIDI to sfizz, generates pattern
                                              MIDI, advances conductor
  if (conductor.playing || hasTailsActive):  ← OTTO's master path (unchanged for
    outputRouter.routeAudio(buffer)           OTTO standalone; SKIPPED by IDA)
    de-click + spectrum + buffer.clear()
  processBlockAfterRouting(N)                ← totalSamplePosition advance +
                                              fillMode sync
  cpuMeter.endMeasurement
```

IDA's `OttoHost::renderBlock`:

```
renderBlock(N, midi):
  if (!prepared || N<=0) return
  ScopedNoDenormals
  processor->processBlockBeforeRouting(midi, N)        ← same Half A prefix
  processor->getPlayerManager().processGlobalMixer(N)  ← per-channel/bus sum;
                                                         populates the 32 stereo
                                                         output accessors IDA's
                                                         Output Mixer reads
  processor->processBlockAfterRouting(N)               ← same Half A suffix
```

Net effect: every audio block IDA's AudioCallback drives drains OTTO's message queue, advances OTTO's conductor + song timeline, dispatches pattern MIDI into sfizz, sums per-channel audio into IDA-readable buffers. The Play→audible chain works because each link runs every block.

OTTO standalone is byte-equivalent to pre-split (verbatim-move discipline + the wrapper preserving order). OTTO's own master mixdown still happens in OTTO standalone; just doesn't happen inside IDA. By design.

`OutputRouter::Mode` is irrelevant on IDA's path (we don't call routeAudio). OTTO's mode-aware master-disable inbox item is independent of S3c.

---

## ▶ 4. Cross-project state — OTTO inbox

OTTO `origin/main` = `ee390098` = IDA's pin (no drift). Five outstanding `[FROM IDA → OTTO]` entries, all `needs-ack` — none added this session except the combined T15 + T15-fixup entry:

1. **EventBus brief** (older, 2026-05-27) — convert `EventBus::publish` to lock-free + alloc-free. Independent of S3c (IDA's TransportEvent handler is RT-clean either way).
2. **RE-APPLY isPluginMode_** (2026-05-28 prior session) — re-apply the `|| proc.isEmbeddedInHost()` to OTTOEditor's `isPluginMode_` initializer. Supports IDA's option-B TransportBar mount. Independent of S3c.
3. **ACK + PIN-BUMP TapeColorProcessor** (2026-05-28 prior session) — informational IDA→OTTO ack of the lsfx_tapecolor short-circuit landing at `0a7189c`. Carries the OTTO-side next-pass list (platform-aware default `quality` + mode-aware default engagement) — those are OTTO's timeline.
4. **AssetsRoot S3b** (2026-05-28 prior session) — singleton + 3 call-site refactors. Independent of S3c.
5. **AudioPump S3c** (2026-05-28 THIS session) — combined T15 + T15-fixup entry. References OTTO commits `d9fc41a0` (initial split) + `ee390098` (fixup). Documents the split contract, the byte-equivalent guarantee for OTTO standalone, the audio-thread invariant inheritance, the `getConductor()` accessor extension rationale, and the test deferral path (`[otto-host-pump]` 4-case suite in IDA covers behavior end-to-end while OTTO's standalone CMake remains broken).

`[FROM OTTO → IDA]`: 0 outstanding.

Audit trail: `git -C external/OTTO log --grep='Ida-Origin'` surfaces every IDA-originated OTTO commit forever, including S3c's two.

---

## ▶ 5. Next-session resume protocol

### Step 1: Read this file.

### Step 2: Inbox check + OTTO origin/main check

```bash
cat /Users/larryseyer/IDA/external/OTTO/CROSS_PROJECT_INBOX.md
git -C /Users/larryseyer/IDA/external/OTTO fetch origin && \
  git -C /Users/larryseyer/IDA/external/OTTO log --oneline ee390098..origin/main
```

If a new `[FROM OTTO → IDA]` entry has landed between sessions, ack + prune per the protocol BEFORE running T17.

### Step 3: Operator T17 — verify Play produces audio (THE point of S3c)

Operator-driven, numbered checklist (per `feedback_clean_builds_only_for_testing` — IDA.app already exists from this session's clean rebuild, no rebuild needed if no source changes occurred between sessions):

1. **Launch** `IDA.app` via the Desktop `IDA` alias. Bar visible across all tabs ✓ (carries from T14 step 1).
2. **OTTO tab → kit picker** → load a real sample-based kit on Player 1 (e.g. LSAD pop, LSAD rock). Picker should show real kits ✓ (carries from T14 step 2 — S3b's win).
3. **Press Play in the IDA bar.** **Audible drumming expected.** This is what S3c fixes.
4. **Press Stop in the IDA bar.** Audio stops.
5. **Adjust tempo on the IDA bar** (or in OTTO's internal display). Pattern playback speed changes audibly.
6. **Transport-bar state echo**: the Play button's visual state should switch to "playing" after step 3 within ~30 ms (the EventBus → SPSC → 30 Hz Timer → listener fan-out). Visible in the bar.

If 3-6 all PASS: **S3c is verified and shipped.** Update `continue.md` with the T17 PASS marker.

If 3 (audio) FAILS despite all 4 `[otto-host-pump]` tests passing in headless: the failure is narrow per design spec §7 — either an asset-path edge case (kit not actually loaded; check OTTO's own UI for kit status) or an Output Mixer wiring issue (OTTO outputs not routed into IDA's master path). **Neither is S3c's scope** — both would be follow-on slices. Document the symptom + which step failed in `continue.md` and brainstorm the narrower diagnostic in a fresh session.

### Step 4: (After T17 PASS) Decide next slice

Candidates queued in `todo.md`:

- **S3c follow-on polish** (this session, non-blocking) — 5 items consolidated. ~30 min for IDA-side items (1)-(3); (4)-(5) are OTTO-side timeline.
- **OTTO Stereo Mix output** (2026-05-27) — 33rd picker entry summing OTTO's PlayerOut1..4 into a single stereo strip. Plan written; waits on M-OTTO-4 slices 4c + 4d.
- **File-input MIDI source** (2026-05-26) — sister of audio file-input; needs spec.
- **Mixer routing + tape pool** — design landed; awaiting implementation slices.

Operator's "near-term order" per `project_mixer_then_transport_roadmap.md`: finish Input Mixer → Output Mixer → then transport + other metering. S3c was a transport-side detour to make OTTO functional inside IDA; the mixer work resumes after T17 confirms S3c.

---

## ▶ 6. Known issues / non-blocking artifacts

- **OTTO standalone CMake still pre-existingly broken** — same as S3b §6. T15's `test_processblock_split_app` target is wired correctly in `external/OTTO/tests/CMakeLists.txt` but won't build until OTTO's host-top-level configure is unblocked. IDA's `[otto-host-pump]` 4-case suite + the OTTO-side `[transport-state-parity]` test (the latter still un-runnable from OTTO standalone, but byte-equivalent under verbatim move) currently close the verification.
- **5 follow-on polish items** queued in `todo.md` 2026-05-28 entry. None threaten correctness or audio-thread safety. Worth landing alongside the next pump-related slice so the test-helper extraction (item 1) lands with new tests that would otherwise duplicate the priming pattern.
- **LSP stale-index artifacts during the session.** The harness's diagnostic system fired stale "abstract class" / "override hides virtual" warnings on `TransportBarHost.h`, `MainComponent.h`, `OttoPaneNoInternalTransportTests.cpp` after T16's signature change. None reflected real build issues — `ctest --test-dir build` returned 813/1 at HEAD throughout. The LSP index doesn't auto-refresh across file changes in this session. If the operator's next session shows the same noise, it's not a code problem.
- **Submodule pin moved past prior session's intent** — same caveat as the prior session's §6 §3 (TAPECOLOR feat + revert pair drift). Now extended by S3c (`ee390098` is forward-only from `4130d7a5` via S3c's two commits + the existing drift). Net OTTO source change: the processBlock split + test + inbox + minor docstring/comment polish. All audited.

---

*End of session. S3c shipped via subagent-driven flow: brainstorm → spec → plan → T15 implementer/spec/quality review + fixup → T16 implementer/spec/quality review → final cross-cutting review. OTTO processBlock split is verbatim-equivalent for OTTO standalone; IDA's pump now drives the full housekeeping prefix + per-channel sum + suffix every audio block. The architectural gap that made Play silent post-S3b is closed. Operator T17 next session is the audible verification. Five follow-on polish items queued in todo.md, all non-blocking.*
